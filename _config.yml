          Writing down your concerns and clarify them.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          When your worries clutter your mind, putting them into words through writing can help alleviate them. Taking inspiration from this, I have envisioned a platform where you can gain clarity about the concerns bothering you, and by putting them into writing, you can alleviate the burden.
