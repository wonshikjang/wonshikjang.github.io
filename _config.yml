  Hi, I'm a M.S Candidate at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST).  
  I work as a AI researcher in Autonomous Computing System Lab (ACSL) under the supervision of Prof. Uehwan Kim
  
  I enjoy traveling to various places around the world to experience the great outdoors, unique cultures, and cuisines.
  I also love artists and bands like Oasis, Coldplay, Nell, and Younha, and I'm a fan of music festivals.

          Writing down your concerns and clarify them.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          When your worries clutter your mind, putting them into words through writing can help alleviate them. Taking inspiration from this, I have envisioned a platform where you can gain clarity about the concerns bothering you, and by putting them into writing, you can alleviate the burden.
